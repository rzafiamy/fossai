# üåê FOSSAI - AI-Powered Open-Source Blog

Welcome to **FOSSAI** - an open-source blog tailored for AI creators. FOSSAI is hosted on [makix.fr](https://makix.fr), where all content is generated by advanced AI with minimal human intervention. Please note that while the AI-generated content is innovative and creative, it may contain hallucinations or errors.

## üõ† Features

- **AI-Generated Content**: Automatically generated blog posts on all topics related to Artificial Intelligence.
- **Minimal Human Intervention**: Content is primarily created by AI, showcasing the power and limitations of modern AI technology.
- **REST API**: A PHP-based backend providing a RESTful API.
- **Frontend Interface**: A responsive and modern web interface for viewing and interacting with the blog.

## üê≥ Docker Compose Setup

FOSSAI can be easily set up using Docker Compose. The setup includes two main services:

- **Frontend** (`localhost:4000`): The web interface where users can explore AI-generated blog posts.
- **Backend API** (`localhost:8080`): A PHP server that provides RESTful API endpoints for the blog.

### üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rzafiamy/fossai.git
    cd fossai
    ```

2. **Start the Services**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

3. **Access the Frontend**:
    - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000`.

4. **Access the REST API**:
    - The REST API is available at `http://localhost:8080`.


## üöÄ Deployment

To deploy FOSSAI, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Frontend Service**:

   First, connect to the running frontend service container using Docker:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it fossai-frontend bash
   ```

   This command opens an interactive bash session inside the frontend service container, named `fossai-frontend`.

2. **Build the Static Files**:

   Inside the container, run the provided build script to generate the necessary files:

   ```bash
   ./tools/build.sh
   ```

   This script compiles and prepares all the files and folders needed for deployment. The generated content will be located in the `dist/www` directory.

3. **Serve Files via API Server**:

   The files inside the `dist/www` directory are automatically served by the API server running on `localhost:8080`. However, if you prefer, you can manually copy these files to your web server for deployment.

   To copy the files to your server:

   - Use `scp`, `rsync`, or any other method to transfer the contents of the `dist/www` directory to your web server‚Äôs document root or desired location.

   Example using `scp`:
   ```bash
   scp -r dist/www/* user@yourserver:/path/to/your/webserver/root/
   ```

   After transferring the files, your web server should now be serving the FOSSAI frontend, and it will be fully operational with the generated content.


## üîß CLI Tools
